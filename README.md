<h1>NASA & Nearest-Earth-Objects</h1>

<p style='font-family: Cascadia Code' >There is an infinite number of objects in the outer space. 
Some of them are closer than we think. Even though we might think that a distance of 70,000 Km can not 
potentially harm us, but at an astronomical scale, this is a very small distance and can disrupt 
many natural phenomena. These asteroids can thus prove to be harmful. 
Hence, it is wise to know what is surrounding us and what can harm us amongst those. 
Thus, this dataset compiles the list of NASA certified asteroids that are classified
as the nearest earth object.</p>

<li><b>id = </b> Unique identifier for each asteroid</li>
<li><b>name = </b> Name given by NASA</li>
<li><b>est_diameter_min = </b> Minimum estimated diameter in kilometres</li>
<li><b>est_diameter_max = </b> Maximum estimated diameter in kilometres</li>
<li><b>relative_velocity = </b> Velocity relative to Earth</li>
<li><b>miss_distance = </b> Distance in kilometres missed</li>
<li><b>orbiting_body = </b> Planet that the asteroid orbits</li>
<li><b>sentry_object = </b> Included in sentry - an automated collision monitoring system</li>
<li><b>absolute_magnitude = </b> Describes intrinsic luminosity</li>
<li><b>hazardous = </b> Boolean feature that shows whether asteroid is harmful or not</li>
